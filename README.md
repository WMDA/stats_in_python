# stats_in_python
A collection of notebooks teaching statistics in python! 

## Who is this for?

This is for people who have a basic understanding of python (i.e know what functions, lists, dictionaries etc are) and who know a bit about stats (what a t-test is etc) but don't know how to do stats in python.

This is primarily aimed at people with a psychology/neuroscience background as the type of stats used in the notebooks are commonly used in these fields. 

## Datasets

The majority of data has been faked (see fake_data_notebook) but done in a way that is hopefully realistic to people studying neuroscience/psychology

## Requirements

I have added in a requirements.txt so people can see what is needed to do stats in python. As this is not an actual python package the toml seemed overkill and I wouldn't recommend trying to install this repo using pip etc.  

## Future ideas

Adding in Bayesian stats (I have notebooks on this they just aren't nicely organised)
Adding in stats in Julia
